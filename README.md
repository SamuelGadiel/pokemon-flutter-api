# Pokemon Flutter API

A simple API to serve some data from pokemons

It shows the following data

* ID
* Name
* Tyoe
* Generation
* Region
* Sprite
* Design

Not all pokemons are included, only the starters from each generation up to generation 8 - Galar.

The base structure of the API was forked from W3CJ's [create-express-api](https://github.com/w3cj/create-express-api)
The pokemon data given by PokeAPI. The data was selected and hardcoded in a `.json` file. So this api only serves this `.json`.
